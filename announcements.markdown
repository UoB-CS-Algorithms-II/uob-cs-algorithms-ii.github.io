# Announcements Page

## Welcome!

Hi all,

Welcome to the algorithms half of Algorithms and Data! Our main unit page is hosted on GitHub Pages [here](http://uob-cs-algorithms-ii.github.io). The first video gives a much more detailed introduction, but in short, this unit will cover material on a rolling basis. For example, for Week 13, I've just released video lectures today (Friday evening), we'll have there's a Blackboard quiz on the material you should get done by the following Friday, then we'll have a 90-minute in-person problem class on it the same day. These problem classes are half-lecture half-lab, and will be focusing on explaining how to apply the material in the video lectures to solve unfamiliar problems - you should definitely come, and you should come having already studied the video lectures. Afterwards we'll release problem sheet solutions and the following week's material, then on the following Monday (January 26th) we'll have a wrap-up Q&A on week 1.

**The weekly quizzes do count towards your unit mark, and are essentially free marks - don't let them slip by!** Again, you should get the first quiz done by the problem class on **Friday January 23rd**.

I hope you all enjoy the unit, and see you on Friday for the first problem class!

Best wishes,

John
