## Week 1 video 3 (Defining O-notation)

In slide 7 on multi-variable O-notation, in the example on f(m,n) &isin; O(g(m,n)), "f(m,n) &le; C &#xb7; mn" should read "f(m,n) &le; C &#xb7; g(m,n)".

## Week 1 video 4 (Using O-notation)

In slide 4 on L'Hôpital's rule, the statement that n &isin; o(b<sup>n</sup>) for all b > 0 should instead require b > 1.

## Week 5 video 4 (Kruskal's algorithm)

In the graph on slide 5, the weight-1 edge should be a weight-10 edge (so that the situation shown in the slides can actually happen). This does not substantively affect the discussion.
